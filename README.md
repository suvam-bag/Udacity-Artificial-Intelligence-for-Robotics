#Introduction
This course goes through the primary concepts of programming a robotic car. Many of the concepts are particularly based on the driving algorithms of the google smart car. Hands on programming exercises in python. Completion of this course will provide any student with a better understanding of artificial intelligence in general along with several filters, path planning, Simultaneous Localization and Localization etc. The repository contains my solutions from this course.

#Platform
   - Python IDLE if using Windows
   - Normal Python interpretor if using Linux

#Note
The repository contains multiple files of my multiple attempts at a single problem.
