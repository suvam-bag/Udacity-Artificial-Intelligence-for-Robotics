# Udacity-Artificial-Intelligence-for-Robotics
Created by Suvam Bag....

#Introduction
This course goes through the primary concepts of programming a robotic car. Many of the concepts are particularly based on the driving algorithms of the google smart car. Hands on programming exercises in python. Completion of this course will provide any student with a better understanding of artificial intelligence in general along with several filters, path planning, Simultaneous Localization and Localization etc. The repository contains my solutions from this course.

#Platform
   - Python IDLE if using Windows
   - Normal Python interpretor if using Linux

#Note
The repository contains multiple files of my multiple attempts at a single problem. 
(A) In shortage of time, please read the descriptions of each lesson from below, and execute the file from lesson6.
(B) Please execute the main files for each lesson from the All_Lessons_Main_Files folder. 

#Lesson1 - Localization: Monte Carlo
A basic implementation of motion planning using localization derived from probabilistic distributions and assumed obstacles in a discrete map. Filters used are histogram filters (Monte Carlo), hence discrete, multimodal. 

#Lesson2 - Localization: Kalman Filters
Motion planning implementing Kalman filters. Advantage of Kalman filters is that they are continuous and efficiency is quadratic.

#Lesson3 - Localization: Particle filters
Motion planning using the predominantly used in real world, particle filters. Particle filters are both continuous and multimodal.

#Leasson4 - Search and Path Planning
Optimal path planning, A* algorithm, Dynamic path planning, Stochastic Motion

#Leason5 - P,D,I filters
Introduction to Proportional, Derivative and integral controller and implementation. 

#Lesson6 - 
Combined implementation of all the lessons from 1-5. This involves localizaiton by particle filters, path planning using A*, stochastic motion, PID controller for handling crosstrack error. The output of this file will result in
